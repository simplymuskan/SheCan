## Inspiration
As two young women who love learning about women health and well-being, it was disheartening for us to see so many women succumb to breast cancer every year world-wide, because of lack of proper medication and awareness.
So we aimed at bringing about a small change by creating a safe space on the internet where all women from different corners of the world get to know about the issue and how to tackle it. We also built a community termed **Pink Warriors** that unites all brave survivors and tells their success stories.
## What it does
The website basically provides a brief intro to breast cancer. We also show some general statistics. 
The **Let's Learn** page provides a cause analysis of the issue and bust some myths.
The **Pink warriors** page showcases our brave survivors and their stories. We also have a _Join Our Community_  option to build on our community.
Finally the **Emergency** page provides the helpline numbers and mails of various cancer organizations with an attached google maps portion.

## How we built it
We created using responsive webpage  and made the web app user friendly. The user interface was created with HTML, and bootstrap and CSS.  Also, we tried to make our website very reactive (ex. changing card colour and size on hover) and focused on general aesthetic appeal, so that the user would be encouraged to continue navigating the site. We also embedded Google map for the benefit of the users.
## Challenges we ran into
We initially wished to learn about firebase and APIs , however since it is our first hackathon, we found it really difficult to implement. Nevertheless we are proud of what we have been able to build.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
During this hackathon, we explored many technologies with which we were previously unfamiliar. None of us had used bootstrap, nor Google Maps. However, we persevered relentlessly and ended up implementing the tools in our project!
## What we learned
We were also able to create an interactive map element using the Google Map. For UI/UX, it was our first time using Bootstrap to assist with the styling of our website. Overall, it was an exhilarating weekend filled with knowledge and fun!
## What's next for SheCan
We aim at implementing APIs and add further features for the future.
